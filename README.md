# Cross Universe Online i18n

This repo has the translation files (English & Japanese) for my site, [Cross Universe Online](https://crossuniverse.psychpsyo.com/). 
The English file (en.json) is in this case the original and will always be complete. 
The Japanese file (ja.json) is still missing some things. (Those are the empty json keys)

## Contributing

To contribute, just fork the repo, make your changes and submit a pull request. 
 
Note: 
Some lines include things like `{#COUNT}`. Those will be replaced with actual numbers by the game and need to be exactly the same in the translated version. (Though you can move them to different points in the sentence.)
